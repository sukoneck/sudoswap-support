# FAQ

## Are my assets locked once I create a swap?
No.

To recap, so far: 
1. You approved for your assets to be swapped *only if that swap is accepted*
2. You created a swap agreement
3. You are waiting for your partner to approve their assets to be swapped and then for your partner to accept the swap

So, the assets have not left your wallet. There is no hold or lock on your assets. There are only the approvals and swap agreement you created. 

## What happens if my parter accepts a swap but I don't have the assets any more?
The swap transaction fails. 

To recap, so far: 
1. You approved for your assets to be swapped *only if that swap is accepted*
2. You created a swap agreement
3. `ISSUE` You sold one or more of the assets in the swap agreement  
4. Your partner approved for their assets to be swapped
5. Your partner accepted the swap 

So, since the swap cannot be fulfilled (due to step #3), the swap transaction will fail.
